# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building predictive models to detect the presence of **diabetes** in patients using clinical features. Early detection of diabetes can improve patient care and reduce the risk of complications. The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains health records of female patients, to perform binary classification.

The notebook includes all necessary steps for a complete ML pipeline: data preprocessing, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, applying feature scaling, training multiple machine learning models, and comparing their performances based on accuracy and generalization ability.

It is an end-to-end ML project suitable for both academic understanding and real-world problem solving in the healthcare domain.
